## Notes API
A very simple [Django](https://djangoproject.com) Rest API for CRUD.The project is implemented using the [Django Rest Framework](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/) .
The API has four main operations
- Create a note (POST)
- Edit a note(PUT)
- Delete a note (DELETE)
- Read a note (GET)
- List all notes (GET)

The main concepts used in the project are
- Rest framework's APIViews
- Serializers
Do grab a copy and have a look as it is a beginner project as I am also a beginner as concerns the Rest framework at the time of writing.

### Stack
- Django==3.0.3
- djangorestframework==3.11.0

I have hosted the project on [PythonAnywhere](https://www.pythonanywhere.com)
